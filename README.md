[Ecommerce Store](https://ecommerce-store-web-app.herokuapp.com/) is a shopping web app that I developed with React. users can filter products based on categories and choose what currency to be used for prices. meanwhile users can add products to their cart with specific features like size, color, quantity, etc...

In the development process I have made the web app keyboard accessible specially when it comes to modals. the web app has reasonable code coverage in terms of testing (unit, integration and end to end) and after each commit/push I was confident enough about it thanks to CircleCI. the UI is responsive enough for mobile users. also the PWA version is worth trying because it feels like a native app.
